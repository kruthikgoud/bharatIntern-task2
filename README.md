# Titanic Dataset Analysis and Prediction

This repository contains a Python project for the analysis and prediction of the Titanic dataset. The dataset is a well-known dataset in the data science community and is often used for machine learning and data analysis practice.

## Overview

The Titanic dataset includes information about passengers on the Titanic, including details such as their age, gender, class, and whether they survived or not. This project aims to explore the dataset, perform data preprocessing, and train machine learning models to predict passenger survival.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- `data/`: This directory contains the dataset files `train.csv` and `test.csv`.

- `Titanic.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code for data analysis, preprocessing, and model training.

- `titanic_dtc.csv`: CSV file containing predictions using the Decision Tree Classifier.

- `titanic_rfc.csv`: CSV file containing predictions using the Random Forest Classifier.

## Getting Started

To run the code and reproduce the analysis and predictions, follow these steps:

1. Clone this GitHub repository to your local machine.

2. Ensure you have the required Python libraries installed. You can install them using pip:
  
3. Open and run the Jupyter Notebook `titanic.ipynb` to perform data analysis, preprocessing, and model training.

4. The trained models will generate prediction files (`titanic_dtc.csv` and `titanic_rfc.csv`) that can be submitted to Kaggle or used for further analysis.

## Results

The project achieved the following results:

- Decision Tree Classifier Accuracy: 78.36%
- Random Forest Classifier Accuracy: 78.36%

## Contributing

Contributions to this project are welcome. You can contribute by improving the analysis, trying different machine learning models, or enhancing the documentation.


## Acknowledgments

- The Titanic dataset is available on Kaggle and was originally provided by Kaggle for the Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster competition.
